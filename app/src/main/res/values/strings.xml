    <!-- TODO: XDA thread
    mDhcp Expl: Sometimes, the DHCP lease of Android gets corrupted. In this case, you are not able to connect to any WiFi network -
        it keeps displaying \"Obtaining IP address&#8230;\" If that is the case, the functionality of WiFi can easily be restored by deleting two files
        contained in /data/misc/dhcp - dhcpcd-wlan0.lease and dhcpcd-wlan0.pid. They will automatically get recreated once you enable WiFi.\n
        \nBy clicking on OK, these two files are going to be deleted.\n\n

    mWpaconf Expl: The file wpa_supplicant.conf (located in /data/misc/wifi) stores all the WiFi passwords of Android. However, for some reason this file gets
        corrupted easily. Deleting it will force Android to recreate it and WiFi will work again.\n
        \nBy clicking on OK, this file is going to be deleted.\n\n
